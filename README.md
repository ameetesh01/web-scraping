# web-scraping

Since, the data used in Myntra are stored in the Script tag rather than usual tag. I was unable to find a way to scrap the data in Myntra. But was able to do it in internshala. I have added both the internshala and Myntra files. I am still figuring out to scrape the data from Myntra. Once completed, I'll update this repo.
